📍What was this project about?

This project is a simple calculator that takes in 3 measurements - your shoulders, waist, and hips - and tells you what your body shape is.


📍Why did you want to build this project?

I love fashion and style and I believe the most important thing to know to have great style is your body shape. I have written a couple articles about knowing your body shape on my fashion blog but I always link to an outside calculator. Once I learned to code I knew I wanted to make one for myself so I didn't have to rely on the availability of an outside calculator. 


📍What hurdles/problems did you run into?

The hardest part was figuring out how to word the if statements so they wouldn't accidentally cancel each other out. I originally had the bust measurement as a required measurement but this was causing a problem because the bust and waist measurements can sometimes be very similar. When the measurements were too similar it would output the wrong body shape and change each time you put those same measurements in.


📍How did you overcome these problems?

After trying to make it work a couple of times I decided to just take out the bust measurement altogether. It is not a crucial measurement to have when figuring out your body shape so it was easier to just take it out rather than spend countless hours trying to figure out how to make it work.


📍What did you learn from this project?

Although this project is fairly simple and straightforward in terms of coding difficulty, I am proud of it because I created everything from scratch. I came up with the idea, deesigned the layout, and did all the coding and logic for it. It gave me a boost of confidence to know I was able to take what I learned in the Skillcrush Bootcamp and apply it to a real life scenario.
